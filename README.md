Story generation with ReRAG and Agentic Context Engineering


Current AI novel generation ofter produce repetitive plots, incostitent plots , weak long term coherence. The quality of generatd novels is not up to par, usually AI gen novels are more like a summary and no emotion, This project was made to research and test the new techniques that could improve this



Baseline: Standard LLM generation (single prompt)

Traditional RAG: Static retrieval of relevant passages

ReRag Only: Recursive retrieval without agents

Full System: ReRag + Agentic Context Engineering
