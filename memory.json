    "summary": "In a tense tea ceremony, mage Rowan faces Inspector Thompson's interrogation about her ailing friend Aldric. As she pours calming herbal tea, Rowan weaves a subtle deception spell to mask the truth about Aldric's disappearance. Thompson's scanner detects magical threads, and his piercing questions force Rowan to maintain a fragile lie about Aldric's 'illness.' Her fabricated story about caring for him crumbles under Thompson's skepticism, while her magic strains to sustain the illusion. The standoff escalates as Thompson's winter-wind voice exposes the precariousness of Rowan's deception, leaving her to wonder how long she can maintain the charade.",
